Diabetes Prediction Model

Developed a machine learning classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the PIMA dataset to predict diabetes.

Applied feature scaling with Scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler, trained the model, and obtained an accuracy of 80%. Created and deployed a predictive system, persisting the trained model with Pickle for future use.

Technologies used include Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Pickle.
